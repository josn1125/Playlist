    <p>Wake up and smell the coffee<br>
    Is your cup half full or empty?<br>
    When we talk, you say it softly<br>
    But I love it when you're awfully quiet<br>
    Hmm, hmm quiet<br>
    Hmm, hmm</p>
    
    <p>You see a piece of paper<br>
    Could be a little greater<br>
    Show me what you could make her<br>
    You'll never know until you try it<br>
    Hmm, hmm<br>
    And you don't have to keep it quiet</p>

    <p>And I know it makes you nervous<br>
    But I promise you, it's worth it<br>
    To show 'em everything you kept inside<br>
    Don't hide, don't hide<br>
    Too shy to say, but I hope you stay<br>
    Don't hide away<br>
    Come out and play</p>

    <p>Look up, out of your window<br>
    See snow, won't let it in though<br>
    Leave home, feel the wind blow<br>
    'Cause it's colder here inside in silence<br>
    You don't have to keep it quiet</p>

    <p>Yeah, I know it makes you nervous<br>
    But I promise you, it's worth it<br>
    To show 'em everything you kept inside<br>
    Don't hide, don't hide<br>
    Too shy to say but I hope you stay<br>
    Don't hide away<br>
    Come out and play</p>
