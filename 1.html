    <p>You leapt from crumbling bridges watching cityscapes turn to dust<br>
    Filming helicopters crashing in the ocean from way above</p>
    
    <p>Got the music in you baby, tell me why<br>
    Got the music in you baby, tell me why<br>
    You've been locked in here forever and you just can't say goodbye</p>

    <p>Kisses on the foreheads of the lovers wrapped in your arms<br>
    You've been hiding them in hollowed out pianos left in the dark</p>

    <p>Got the music in you baby, tell me why<br>
    Got the music in you baby, tell me why<br>
    You've been locked in here forever and you just can't say goodbye</p>

    <p>Your lips, my lips, apocalypse<br>
    Your lips, my lips, apocalypse<br>
    Go and sneak us through the rivers flood is rising up on your knees, oh please<br>
    Come out and haunt me, I know you want me<br>
    Come out and haunt me</p>

    <p>Sharing all your secrets with each other since you were kids<br>
    Sleeping soundly with the locket that she gave you clutched in your fist</p>
    
    <p>Got the music in you baby, tell me why<br>
    Got the music in you baby, tell me why<br>
    You've been locked in here forever and you just can't say goodbye<br>
    You've been locked in here forever and you just can't say goodbye</p>

    <p>Oh, when you're all alone, I will reach for you<br>
    When you're feeling low, I will be there, too</p>
