    <p>I don't love you anymore<br>
    A pretty line that I adore<br>
    Five words that I've heard before</p>
    
    <p>'Cause you keep me on a rope<br>
    And tied a noose around my throat<br>
    You're gone, then back at my door</p>

    <p>'Cause if you're gonna leave<br>
    Better leave, better do it fast<br>
    Can't live a little longer<br>
    Sitting on your lap</p>

    <p>'Cause you know what you're doing<br>
    When you're coming back<br>
    And I don't want to have<br>
    Another heart attack</p>

    <p>Oh, I can't be<br>
    Your lover on a leash<br>
    Every other week<br>
    When you please</p>

    <p>Oh, I can't be<br>
    The kiss that you don't need<br>
    The lie between your teeth<br>
    The cut that always bleeds<br>
    The cut that always bleeds</p>
    
    <p>Say you love somebody new<br>
    And beat my heart, to black and blue<br>
    Then they leave, and it's me<br>
    You come back to</p>

    <p>To say you loved me all along<br>
    And kissed the bruises 'til they're gone<br>
    Bittersweet, 'cause I can't breathe<br>
    Inside your arms</p>

    <p>'Cause if you're gonna leave<br>
    Better leave, better do it fast<br>
    Can't live another minute<br>
    Bleeding from my back<br>
    'Cause I don't have another one<br>
    For you to stab<br>
    And I don't want to have<br>
    Another heart attack</p>

    <p>Oh I can't be<br>
    Your lover on a leash<br>
    Every other week<br>
    When you please</p>

    <p>Oh, I can't be<br>
    The kiss that you don't need<br>
    The lie between your teeth<br>
    The cut that always bleeds<br>
    The cut that always bleeds</p>

    <p>But even though you're killing me<br>
    I, I need you like the air I breathe<br>
    I need, I need you more than me<br>
    I need you more than anything<br>
    Please, please</p>

    <p>'Cause I could be<br>
    Your lover on a leash<br>
    Every other week<br>
    When you please</p>

    <p>Oh, I could be<br>
    Anything you need<br>
    As long as you don't leave<br>
    The cut that always</p>
